# GifTastic

 - GifTastic is a GIPHY API dynamic web page that populats with gifs
 - The page has preset buttons that target specific gif topics: Emotions, Reactions, Adjectives, Actions, and Trending gifs
 - When you clock on a specific button it displays a span of 10 gifs related to that topic and displays them on the HTML page
 - When the user clicks on the gif image itself, the gif will animate, when clicking on the same gif it will go back to still mode and so forth
 - User can also type in a new topic in the input form to generate a new button, when user clicks on new topic button it will generate 10 static gif from that topic
 - User can then click on each gif to animate that gif as well

 I hope you enjoy my GifTastic web page!
